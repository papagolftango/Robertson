Arduino control clock restoration

Place holder information and questions.

From the circuit diagram of the Arduino shield <TODO - Attach document >  the following Arduino Due pins are defined:

ClkInPin       = 2; // input clock pin. rising endge pulse for 250mS, 1Hz
ClkInRefPin    = 3; // input clock reference for comparison with the input clock and subsequent adjustment
HalfMinOutPin  = 4; // out pulse every 30s aligned with the input clock. Pulse of 250mS duration
Unknown1       = 5; // <TODO  - check what the function of this pin is >
Unknown2       = 6  // <TODO  - check what the function of this pin is >
PllStep0OutPin = 7; // Drive a stepper motor to apply timing correction to the clock <TODO check stepper motor drive type
PllStep1OutPin = 8; // Drive a stepper motor to apply timing correction to the clock <TODO check stepper motor drive type
Step0OutPin    = 9; // <TODO - check function >
Step1OutPin    = 10;// <TODO - check function >

LED_BUILTIN    = 13;// Standard Arduino LED

NOTES:
the example code given here will be built up in simple stages to demonstrate some arduino and programming concepts.

Stage 1: Receive an input clock (for simplicity, this clock will be generated by the Due itself and will require a wired connection from pin 13 to pin 2). Generate an interrupt on the rising edge. Assume no debounce is required for this stage. In this example we will also generate the same interrupt on the falling edge and we will use this to time onther pulses.

The ISR will generate the 1/2 minute pulse by counting 30 seconds
